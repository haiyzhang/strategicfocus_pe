# Strategic Focus: Evidence from Private Equity Transactions in US Power Generation

This repository provides a public overview of my research project on strategic focus and 
private equity ownership in the U.S. power generation sector.


---

## Overview

This project studies how private equity ownership can create "scale without scope" by 
focusing resources on a narrower set of core generating technologies. Using high-frequency 
production data from the EPA and transaction data from Capital IQ, I estimate the impact of 
PE ownership on unit efficiency and examine the role of strategic focus as an 
experience amplifier.

Key elements of the analysis include:

- High-frequency EPA CAMD production data (unit-hour level)
- Ownership and transaction data from S&P Capital IQ Pro
- Difference-in-differences with staggered adoption (Callaway & Sant’Anna, 2021)
- Event-study estimates of post-acquisition efficiency gains
- Organizational-level measures of technological scope and scale
- Tests of strategic focus as a supermodular learning mechanism
